# What's that?

PrettyTest is a simple testing library without bells & whistles that
produces pretty outputs.

![PrettyTest](http://remogatto.github.io/images/prettytest.png)

# Features

PrettyTest main features are:

  * A simple assertion vocabulary for better readability
  * Customizable formatters through interfaces
  * It's integrated with the go test command
  * It can use [gocheck](http://labix.org/gocheck) checkers (experimental)
  * It has pretty and colorful output with reports

# Quick start

~~~go
package foo

import (
	"github.com/remogatto/prettytest"
	"testing"
)

// Start of setup
type testSuite struct {
	prettytest.Suite
}

func TestRunner(t *testing.T) {
	prettytest.RunWithFormatter(
		t,
		new(prettytest.TDDFormatter),
		new(testSuite),
	)
}
// End of setup


//your tests start here
func (t *testSuite) TestTrueIsTrue() {
	t.True(true)
}

func (t *testSuite) TestEquality() {
	t.Equal("awesome", "awesome")
}

func (t *testSuite) TestNegation() {
	t.Not(t.Equal("awesome", "not good"))
}


//failing test

func (t *testSuite) TestInequality() {
	t.Equal("awesome", "pretty")
}
~~~

Then, to run the tests simply use the the go test command:

~~~bash
$ go test

testSuite:
	OK	TestComposition               (2 assertion(s))
	OK	TestEquality                  (1 assertion(s))
	F	TestInequality                (1 assertion(s))
	OK	TestTrueIsTrue                (1 assertion(s))

4 tests, 3 passed, 1 failed, 0 pending, 0 with no assertions
--- FAIL: TestRunner (0.00 seconds)
prettytest.go:453: 	Expected awesome to be not equal to awesome -- /home/andrea/src/sandbox/go/prettytest/example_test.go:39
		
FAIL
exit status 1

# PrettyAutoTest

PrettyAutoTest is a command that continously watches for changes in
your source directory and - in case - re-executes the
tests. PrettyAutoTest promotes an agile development approach: write
tests, write the implementation that satisfies the tests, have an
immediate visual feedback about your progress.

$ go get -v github.com/remogatto/prettytest/pta/
~~~
